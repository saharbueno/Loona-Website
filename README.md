## Purpose & Takeaways

This was my first attempt at writing my own Javscript that reacts to user interaction. I used built-in functions such as addEventListener and created my own functions in order to create visually appealing effects such as the background color changing when a user hovers their mouse over a Loona member's picture in the Members page. I also challenged myself to use CSS media queries in order to create a responsive website that remains neat and functional on desktop, tablet, and phone resolutions. Overall, I had a fun time designing this site and getting over the challenges of responsive design!
