            <h2>An Introduction to Loona</h2>
            <p id="text-page-1">Loona is a South Korean girl group created by the entertainment company BlockberryCreative. Loona’s Korean name is romanized as Idalui Sonyeo, which means “Girl of the Month.” This name is a key component to Loona’s formation as their concept director, Jaden Jeong, had planned a specific pre-debut project for the group. From October 2016 to June 2018, according to Jaden’s plan, all the members of the group were revealed one by one. Each member had their own single album and music video for the title track. In addition, each member was assigned their own representative month, color, and animal. By June 2018, there was a total of 12 members revealed, completing the member line-up for the group and setting the stage for their official debut as a group.
